# webgl-security
public key encryption + arbitrary precision (max modulo word size 128 bit?, vec4?) using webgl etc. e.g. RSA, ECC, Lattice...


Currently just a cute idea I have in my head, no code committed yet.

Although I have some ideas, where to start.

It will be DH-ish algorithms first.

Key exchange, Signing, Confirmation, and then maybe some symmetric ones e.g. Blowfish.
Also, why reinvent the wheel when you have emscripten.

WiP.
